Capture The Feature Flagger

Created from the idea in this gist https://gist.github.com/nwillems/a65126c0065950937eb4c65d1a0345fa

## TODO
The below list is for household tasks - features should go into issues(I guess)

- [ ] Implement https://github.com/securego/gosec
- [ ] Add Github Action to create docker image on main(latest)
- [ ] Make something with releases
- [ ] Add Github Action for testing PRs
- [ ]
